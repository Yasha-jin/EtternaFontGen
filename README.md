## F.A.Q
**Q: This character is missing**

A: All the character sets in the generator are based on pre-existing sets, from the fallback theme, and commonly used set from the old generator. However, the more character the I support, the more time etterna will take to load, and refresh textures. As such, I try to keep the amount of characters low, and only have what's essentials. If the character that is missing is from a song from a public pack, i will add them. However, if you want to add character which are used nowhere, you will have to add them manually. You can learn more about that [Here](https://github.com/Yasha-jin/EtternaFontGen/wiki/How-to-add-custom-characters-set). I already added korean and chinese preset, so they can easily be generated. WARNING : As said, the more character you add, the more time etterna will take to load, so only add them if you really want them.

**Q: Will you support Linux/MacOS ?**

A: I have no idea how font work on those platform.

**Q: Why make a new font generator ?**

A: The existing one is pretty old, and is really an hassle to use, from simply making it work, to using separate program (?????) for latin and jp character. So i made a new one, which is plug-n-play, and it just work. No more pain.
