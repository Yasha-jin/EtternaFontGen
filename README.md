## F.A.Q
**Q: Why no support for Linux/MacOS ?**

A: I have no idea how font work on those platform.

**Q: Why make a new font generator ?**

A: The existing one is pretty old, and is really an hassle to use, from simply making it work, to using separate program (?????) for latin and jp character. So i made a new one, which is plug-n-play, and it just work. No more pain.

**Q: This character does not work !**

A: I have tried to add has many character as possible, however i gathered them from pre-existing font made for etterna. While there is already a large amount of supported character, it may miss some as well, if you know of any, open an issue and provide them, so i can add them.
